## About The Project

**Siakang Dark Mode** is a Tampermonkey userscript designed to enhance the user experience on [Siakang Untirta](https://siakang.untirta.ac.id/) by applying a consistent dark theme and optimizing the user interface. This script aims to reduce eye strain during late-night study sessions and declutter the interface for better focus.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Dark Theme**: Applies a dark background to all major elements of the site.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Adjusts text and background colors for tables, navigation bars, sidebars, and other components to ensure clarity.
- **UI Declutter**: Hides non-essential menus and elements such as "System Setting," the "Change Language" option, and the profile picture in the navbar for a cleaner look.
- **Persistent Sidebar Preference**: Remembers your preferred sidebar size using local storage, so it stays the same on every page reload.
